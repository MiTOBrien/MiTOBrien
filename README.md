## Hi there! I'm Michael O'Brien. Thanks for stopping by.

I am Turing School of Software & Design graduate and a Full Stack Developer.
On the frontend I mostly work with Vue, React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
On the backend I mostly work with Ruby on Rails and PostgresSQL databases.

When not coding I enjoy SCUBA diving, bicyling, and rock climbing.

Want to collaborate or just get to know each other, reach out.
I am always happy to chat.
